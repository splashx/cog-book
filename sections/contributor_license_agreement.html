<h1>23. Contributor License Agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-license-agreement" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Operable requires a Contributor License Agreement to be completed in
most cases for contributions to be accepted. You can read more about our
policy at GitHub in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/operable/cog/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</p>
<p>If you have not completed an agreement, you will be prompted when
creating a pull request with the necessary link to do so. For your
convenience, the text of the agreement is included below.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&#8212; Operable, Inc.</div>
<div class="line">Contributor License Agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) V1.0</div>
</div>
<p>In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, Operable, Inc. (&#8220;Operable&#8221;)
must have a Contributor License Agreement (&#8220;CLA&#8221;) agreed to by each
Contributor. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as
well as the protection of Operable; it does not change your rights to
use your own Contributions for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Either individuals or business entities, including without limitation,
all employees or agents acting on behalf of such entity (an &#8220;Entity&#8221;),
may submit Contributions to Operable under this Agreement. If you click
the checkbox below to indicate that you are entering this Agreement on
behalf of an Entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind
such Entity to this Agreement, in which case, the terms &#8220;You&#8221; and &#8220;Your&#8221;
shall refer to such Entity, as further defined below.</p>
<p>Please read this document carefully before agreeing to it, and print a
copy for your records.</p>
<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for (i)
UNLESS OTHERWISE GOVERNED BY A WRITTEN LICENSE AGREEMENT, ALL
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED TO OPERABLE and
(ii) Your present and future Contributions submitted to Operable. Except
for the license granted herein to Operable and recipients of software
distributed by Operable, You reserve all right, title, and interest in
and to Your Contributions.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Definitions. &#8220;You&#8221; (or &#8220;Your&#8221;) shall mean the copyright owner or
Entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
Agreement with Operable. For Entities, the Entity making a
Contribution and all other Entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control with that Entity are considered to be a
single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, &#8220;control&#8221;
means (i)the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. &#8220;Contribution&#8221; shall
mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or
additions to an existing work, that is or has been intentionally
submitted by You to Operable for inclusion in, or documentation of,
any of the products owned or managed by Operable (the &#8220;Work&#8221;). For
the purposes of this definition, &#8220;submitted&#8221; means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Operable or its
representatives, including but not limited to communication on
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Operable for
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by You as &#8220;Not a Contribution.&#8221;</li>
<li>Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to Operable and to recipients of
software distributed by Operable a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
derivative works.</li>
<li>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, You hereby grant to Operable and to recipients of software
distributed by Operable a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. You furthermore agree to notify Operable of any patents
that you know or come to know are likely infringed by the
Contribution and/or are not licensable by You. If any entity
institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that
Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.</li>
<li>Representations.<ul>
<li>If You are entering this Agreement as an individual, You represent
that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your
employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create,
such as your Contributions, You represent that You have received
permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that
Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to
Operable, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate
CLA with Operable.</li>
<li>If You are entering this Agreement on behalf of an Entity, You
represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
license. You represent further that each employee of the Entity
that submits Contributions is authorized to submit such
Contributions on behalf of the Entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details
of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not
limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are
personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.</li>
<li>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
Contributions on an &#8220;AS IS&#8221; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</li>
<li>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
You may submit it to Operable separately from any Contribution,
identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally
aware, and conspicuously marking the work as &#8220;Submitted on behalf of
a third-party: [named here]&#8221;.</li>
<li>You agree to notify Operable of any facts or circumstances of which
you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in
any respect.</li>
